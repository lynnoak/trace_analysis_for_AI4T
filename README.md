# Trace_Analysis_for_AI4T
In our AI4T project on using AI knowledge for teacher training, learning analytics is an important tool for assessing the quality of various online courses and understanding teachers' digital behaviour. However, our training materials are hosted on different e-learning platforms in five different countries, which leads to data-related challenges due to localisation issues, content differences and different technological setups. In order to effectively apply learning analytics to the learning data collected from teachers in these five countries, to identify commonalities across different groups of teachers and to present the results of the learning analytics to educators and teachers with limited knowledge of the field, this paper proposes the concept of 'Descriptive Cards'. These cards encapsulate 'Indicators' that summarise the common attributes of a group of teachers, providing a visualisation tool. In addition, we propose a "Descriptive Card Mining" approach to extract descriptive cards that reveal common patterns in teacher groups.
